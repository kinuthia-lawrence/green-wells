## 1. üìã Project Title & Short Description

**SmartGas Pro** is a revolutionary IoT-enabled Pay-As-You-Go LPG system that transforms how Kenyans access and consume cooking gas. Our smart meters attach to LPG cylinders, allowing customers to purchase gas credits via mobile money (starting from KES 50) instead of buying full cylinders upfront.

The system monitors gas consumption in real-time, automatically shuts off supply when credits are exhausted, and provides critical safety features including leak detection and emergency response. Customers use our Flutter mobile app or USSD to top up credits, monitor usage, track spending, and receive safety alerts.

For Green Wells Energy, our React-based operations dashboard provides AI-powered route optimization, predictive maintenance scheduling, and comprehensive analytics. The system creates recurring revenue streams while expanding market reach to low-income families who previously couldn't afford LPG.

Our Java-based IoT devices ensure reliable monitoring, Kotlin Android integration enables seamless mobile payments, and Laravel backend manages the complete ecosystem. This transforms Green Wells from a cylinder distributor into a technology-driven energy service provider, positioning them as market leaders in the digital energy revolution.

## 2. üéØ Thematic Relevance

### **Primary Themes Addressed:**

**üîß Smart Operations & Workflow Management**

- AI-powered route optimization for delivery and maintenance teams
- Predictive maintenance using IoT sensor data and machine learning
- Digital cylinder lifecycle tracking through QR codes and smart meters
- Automated workflow for refill scheduling based on consumption patterns

**üë• Reimagining the Consumer Experience**

- Revolutionary pay-as-you-go model eliminating upfront cylinder costs
- Real-time usage tracking and spending analytics via mobile app
- Instant safety notifications and emergency response system
- Family monitoring dashboard for parents to ensure children's safety

**‚ö° Fleet, Delivery & Logistics Intelligence**

- Machine learning algorithms optimizing delivery routes based on demand
- Predictive analytics forecasting refill needs before customers run out
- Real-time fleet tracking and driver performance monitoring
- Emergency dispatch system for rapid response to safety incidents

### **Operational Challenge Solved:**

Traditional LPG distribution requires customers to purchase expensive full cylinders (KES 2,500+), creating barriers for 40% of Kenyan households. Safety incidents occur due to lack of monitoring, while businesses operate inefficiently without demand prediction or route optimization.

### **Community Challenge Solved:**

Energy poverty affects millions who cannot afford LPG upfront costs, forcing reliance on unsafe alternatives like charcoal. Our micro-payment system (KES 50 minimum) makes clean energy accessible while IoT safety monitoring protects families from gas-related accident.
