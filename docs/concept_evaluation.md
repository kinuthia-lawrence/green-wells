## Sensor-Backend Communication Methods

This project recommends two best-in-class technologies for real-world smart gas meter communication:

---

### 1. HTTP POST over GSM/Cellular

- **How it works:**  
  The microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi) reads sensor data, formats it (e.g., as JSON), and sends it to the backend server using HTTP POST via a GSM module and SIM card.
- **Advantages:**  
  - Direct and reliable data transmission.
  - Easy to implement with existing libraries and hardware.
  - Works anywhere with cellular coverage.
  - Ideal for urban/suburban deployments and rapid MVP rollout.
- **Bidirectional:**  
  The device can poll the backend for commands or configuration updates.

---

### 2. LoRaWAN

- **How it works:**  
  The microcontroller sends sensor data via a LoRa module to a LoRaWAN gateway. The gateway forwards the data to the backend server over the internet.
- **Advantages:**  
  - Long-range, low-power communication (up to 10+ km).
  - Cost-effective for rural or large-scale deployments.
  - No SIM/data cost per device if you own the gateway.
  - Excellent for battery-powered and remote installations.
- **Bidirectional:**  
  Supports downlink messages from backend to device for control or updates.

## Data Flow Overview

1. Sensor reads gas flow.
2. Microcontroller processes the reading.
3. Data is formatted (e.g., JSON).
4. Data is transmitted to backend via HTTP POST (GSM) or LoRaWAN.
5. Backend receives and stores the data for use by web and mobile applications.
